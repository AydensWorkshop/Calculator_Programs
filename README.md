# Welcome to Ayden's TI-84 Plus Program Repository

This repository is where you can view and download the TI-Basic calculator programs featured on the [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AydensWorkshop). The folders above contain the following:

*   .8xp files that run the programs
*   .txt files of the code (some characters are not displayed correctly; see below)
*   README files that explain the purpose and usage of the programs

Notes:

*   These programs are meant for the **TI-84 Plus Calculator**. Most of them are compatible with the TI-83 Plus, but they will not work on the TI-84 Plus Color Edition. The TI-84 Plus CE has different graphics mechanics and a different resolution, so the programs will not be formatted correctly.
*   **Some characters in the text files will not display in github** (like the negative symbol and the delta symbol). These characters will reappear if the text is copied into a TI-Basic editor like TI Connect. If you want to fully view the program, download the .8xp file and view it in TI Connect.
*   All of the programs are written in TI-Basic. None of them are written in assembly or need to be compiled. They can all be downloaded and run normally.
