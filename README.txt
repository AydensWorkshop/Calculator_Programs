#Welcome to Ayden's TI-84 Plus Program Repository#

This repository is where you can view and download the calculator programs featured on the [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AydensWorkshop). The folders above contain the following:

*   .8xp files that run the programs
*   .txt files of the code (so you can read them in github)
*   README files that explain the purpose and usage of the programs

Notes:

*   These programs are meant for the **TI-84 Plus Calculator**. Most of them are compatible with the TI-83 Plus, but they will not work on the TI-84 Plus Color Edition. The TI-84 Plus CE has different graphics mechanics and a different resolution, so the programs will not be formatted correctly.
*   Some characters in the text files will not display in github. The characters will reappear if the text files are copied into a TI-Basic editor like TI Connect or TI Connect CE.

###How to Download TI-84 Plus Programs on Your Calculator###

1. [Download](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw) TI Connect (or TI Connect CE) on your computer.
2. Connect your calculator to your computer with a Mini USB-B cable.
3. Download the .8xp file and open it in TI Connect. Alternatively, you can copy the .txt file and paste it into a new TI Connect program.
4. Send the program to the connected calculator.
5. The program can be found in the programs list by clicking the PRGM button.
